            My Name is Andr√©s Reales. I'm from Barranquilla, Colombia. I'm a very passionate about learning new technologies and
            developing software applications. I mainly use technologies such as .Net Core, C#, SQL Server, Angular
             4, Javascript, jQuery Libraries, Xamarin for development. I like working not only on backend development, but also
            frontend development of an application. I like to use javascript libraries such as Greensock.js, ScrollMagic.js, three.js 
            to design and create innovative web designs on my spare time. Also, I'm very interest in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality 
            development.
