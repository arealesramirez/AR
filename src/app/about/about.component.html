            My Name is Andr√©s Reales. I'm from Barranquilla, Colombia. I'm a very passionate about new technologies and building applications.
            I mainly use technologies such as .Net Core, C#, SQL Server, Javascript, SCSS and HTML to develop new applications.
            However, I've also worked with other technologies such Xamarin, WordPress, PHP, Angular 2. I like working on
            the back end and front end of an application, and how applications go front zero to hero in terms of functionality
            and User Experience. However, I find more encouraging working on the User Experience side of development, trying
            to add creative and fresh designs that an app needs.
